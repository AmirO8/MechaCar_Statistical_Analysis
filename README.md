The Vehicle Length(2.60e-12) and ground clearance(5.21e-08)  have the smallest p-value. Which means we can reject the null hypothesis.
The slope of is .71 so our we can use this model to predict future mpg to other metrics.

The variance for Lot1 and Lot1 do not exceed the required 100 PSI. They are .98 and 7.47 respectively. Lot3 on the other hand has a variance of 170.29 which does not meet the requirements. However when we take a look at the Lots as a group they have a variance of 62.29 which is sufficient.
